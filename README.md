<h2>Overview</h2>
Your challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:
- [x] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [x] Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

  <img alt="JavaScript" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-ffd32b?style=flat-square&logo=JavaScript&logoColor=black" />
  
  <img alt="SASS" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-SASS-bf4080?style=flat-square&logo=sass&logoColor=white" />
</p>
<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    I do not normally use the input methods for HTML elements and I never knew there were so many different "on" states for inputs!
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    The code for this project was pretty messy and rushed, I was very tired while doing this and is something I aim to avoid in the future.
    I would revisit the HTML, SASS and JS for this project and change most of the elements, classes and styles for a more DRY approach.
